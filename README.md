##  Project Overview
Banks need to detect fraud quickly and accurately.  
This project:
- Cleans and preprocesses transaction data
- Builds and compares models (Logistic Regression vs Random Forest)
- Evaluates performance using **Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC**
- Deploys a **Streamlit app** where users can enter transaction details and get fraud predictions
